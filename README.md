# Workshop_1

This is the repository in which I'll be showing the ETL process for the ETL's signature at Universidad Autonoma de Occidente. We have been requested to start load the dataset which has 50,000 rows and 11 columns. Here we will have to create the database, its tables as well as loading the data that has been modified from a CSV file according to the objectives of this excersice. This has been done in Jupyter notebooks.
