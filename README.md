# Workshop_1

This is the repository in which I'll be showing the ETL process for the ETL's signature at Universidad Autonoma de Occidente. Here we will have to create the database, its tables as well as loading the data that has been modified from a CSV file according to the objectives of this excersice. This has been done in Jupyter notebooks.

#  Quick Data Overview

 We have been requested to start load the dataset which has 50,000 rows and 11 columns, which are the next ones:
 - First name, Last Name, Email, country, Application Date, Years of Experience (YOE), Seniority Level, Technology, Code Challenge Score, Technical Interview.

# Objectives

This workshop aimed to develop an ETL process that involves creating a relational database from a Python script. The script is responsible for creating the tables and loading them with the data that has been transformed from the CSV file to the Postgres database.

The workshop also aimed to produce visualizations of the following queries using PowerBI:
- Hires by technology (pie chart).
- Hires by year (horizontal bar chart).
- Hires by seniority (bar chart).
- Hires by country over years (USA, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador only).
